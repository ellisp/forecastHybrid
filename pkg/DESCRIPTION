Description: Convenient functions for ensemble forecasts in R combining
    approaches from the 'forecast' package. Forecasts generated from auto.arima(), ets(),
    thetaf(), nnetar(), stlm(), tbats(), and snaive() can be combined with equal weights, weights
    based on in-sample errors (introduced by Bates & Granger (1969) <doi:10.1057/jors.1969.103>),
    or cross-validated weights. Cross validation for time series data with user-supplied models
    and forecasting functions is also supported to evaluate model accuracy.
