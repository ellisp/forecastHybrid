Description: Convenient functions for ensemble forecasts in R combining
    approaches from the 'forecast' package. Forecasts generated from auto.arima(), ets(),
    thetam(), nnetar(), stlm(), and tbats() can be combined with equal weights, weights
    based on in-sample errors, or CV weights. Cross validation for time series data
    and user-supplied models and forecasting functions is also supported to evaluate model accuracy.
